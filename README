$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=number.printer -DartifactId=convert-number-to-words-or-roman-numerals -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

Project goal:
    for numbers (Arabic numerals) in the range 1 - 3999
        convert number to word(s)
        conver number to Roman numerals

Words example:
1 = one
21 = twenty one
105 = one hundred and five
56945781 = fifty six million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and eighty one

Roman example:
    To shorten the number of symbols used to represent a number the placement of a numeral within a number can sometimes indicate subtraction rather than addition.
    For example rather than writing 4 as IIII they would instead write IV (5 minus 1). Note that such subtraction is only valid for the following cases:
    I can be placed before V and X to make 4 units (IV) and 9 units (IX) respectively
    X can be placed before L and C to make 40 (XL) and 90 (XC) respectively
    C can be placed before D and M to make 400 (CD) and 900 (CM) respectively
    So, for example, representing 999 as IM is not valid.

Examples:
9 = IX
555 = DLV
999 = CMXCIX
1974 = MCMLXXIV
2999 = MMCMXCIX
